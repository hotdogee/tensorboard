vz-chart-tooltip is a generic component that renders a component using the
portal technique.

Especially with the shadow DOM, it is hard to make modal/tooltips appear above
other DOM elements not occuluded by scrollbar. The portal technique essentially
renders a DOM on body at the end while keeping it accessible by components
deeply nested inside others. The component tries to keep how/where it is
rendered transparent from the client DOM.

Example usage:
  <vz-chart-tooltip position="auto" content-component-name="foo-bar">
  </vz-chart-tooltip>
-->
<dom-module id="vz-chart-tooltip">
  <script src="vz-chart-tooltip.js"></script>
</dom-module>
